                <h2>About This Site</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Cook With Me, your go-to destination for delicious and easy-to-follow recipes! Whether you're a novice in the kitchen or an experienced chef, our site is designed to inspire and empower you to create mouthwatering dishes.</p>
                <p>This website was built using HTML and CSS for a clean, responsive design that enhances user experience. It introduces PHP by utilizing databases to store and retrieve recipes, allowing users to explore a wide variety of culinary options.</p>
                <p>This project focuses on developing a responsive HTML-based web application that equips students with foundational skills in server-side programming. By creating a functioning prototype, students will learn to handle user input, manage databases, and implement features like authentication and RESTful APIs. The project will include wireframe designs and a style inventory to guide the development process. By the end of this process, students will have a fully functional recipe site with search features and consolidated code.</p>
