        <h1>Cook With Me Case Study</h1>
        <h2>The Overview</h2>
            <p>The Cook With Me recipe site was a project in my Scripting for Interactive Digital Media course, aimed at enhancing my PHP, HTML, and CSS skills. The goal was to create a fully responsive recipe website that pulled data from a MySQL database and displayed it effectively. Key features included a search bar, user-friendly interface, and a sticky sidebar for ingredients.</p>
            <p>The project process involved designing the layout, developing a functional style guide, organizing data in phpMyAdmin, and developing the site with VSCode. I faced challenges with PHP and SQL, especially when setting up the database and creating the search functionality, but I overcame these through collaboration and research.</p>
            <p>The site was completed within the 10-week timeline, meeting all project requirements. It features recipe cards, a working search bar, and a responsive layout. While I would have liked to add features like user login or recipe submissions, I am proud of the final product and the skills I gained, particularly in PHP and MySQL.</p>
        <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
            <p>The Cook With Me recipe site all started with a project in my Scripting for Interactive Digital Media course. The purpose of this course and project was to develop skills working with PHP, and to strengthen my existing knowledge of HTML and CSS. Our task was to build a recipe website that pulled recipes and other information from a database to display them in a functional and pleasing way. There were several project parameters:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The site must use: <ul>
                    <li>PHP</li>
                    <li>MYSQL</li>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>The site must:<ul>
                    <li>display all recipes</li>
                    <li>provide a user interface for browsing, searching, and filtering</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>All projects must be self-hosted.</li>
                <li>All data must be stored and served from a MySQL database</li>
                <li>All sites must be fully responsive</li>      
            </ol>
            <p>This project sought to teach us as students valuable php skills. The website itself is created in order to create a user-friendly cookbook that can be referenced and used by anyone with ease. To measure success for this project, I set out to complete all project parameters and create a friendly design that was inviting and helpful to the user.  I sought out to work with my resources, the class lectures, and my peers, to accomplish this goal. This was an individual project, but we were encouraged as a class to work together to help each other sort our data and work through our understanding of php code. </p>
        <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
            <h3>Design</h3>
                <img class="case-studyimg" src="/content/StyleGuide.png" alt="image of style guide">
                <p>I started with the style guide for this project. I was inspired by an image on adobe stock that I used in my project. Wanting to stray from my usual color choices, I was drawn to the purples and oranges in the image. I had debated whether to use orange and green or orange and purple. Green was more generally associated with food; however I was really attached to the dark purple and wanted to branch out from general food branding. </p>
                <p>I wanted to create a functional layout for this website that would help all users. I highlighted the idea of using a sticky sidebar that would stay next to the recipe. I was inspired by my own experience with recipe sites, more specifically my frustration with having to constantly scroll up to see how much of which ingredient I need to add. With this layout I removed the need to scroll as the user will have it readily available on the side. Overall, I went for a simple layout that would utilize grids as I knew I would have to execute it in my code. </p>
                <img class="case-studyimg" src="/content/LowFidelityImg.png" alt="image of prototype">
                <p>Finally, I developed a mid-fidelity prototype so I could better picture my website. Most features translated over well from the wireframes, but I did have to make some adjustments. I could only have the sticky ingredients section for the desktop/tablet mode. This is because when it got down to mobile sizes, the vertical screen real estate would have been consumed by the ingredients. I decided to prioritize the users reading experience over the ease of scrolling when it came to mobile design and removed the sticky property at smaller screen sizes. I enjoyed using my style guide and bringing the website to life. This step really helped me contextualize what my site would look like and helped me visualize what I wanted to later recreate in my code. </p>
            <h3>Data Organization</h3>
                <p>My class worked as a group to convert the recipe PDFs into a shared table. We each assigned ourselves three to five recipes to bring into a shared excel sheet and then got to work. Using delimiters, we separated out steps and ingredients. However, on this shared table we did not have images. My friend Lucia had gone through and cleaned all of the images- resizing them to the same size. She shared the content folder with us, and we were able to download them. I went through and renamed all of the image files to “HeroImg” and then “Step#” before dragging the folders into my content folder. Then I downloaded a copy of the existing table and added two more columns: the mainimg column and the stepimg column. I used links to the images in my content folder for these columns. For the stepimg column, I included all links to the number of steps and inserted delimiters so they would be separated. </p>
                <p>Next, I had to upload the table to phpMyAdmin. This was one of the longer parts of my process. The table had several errors, and I struggled with the unfamiliar UI of phpMyAdmin. However, using the power of google and phone a friend, I was able to finally upload my table. It still had some errors in the information itself, but those errors allowed me to learn SQL code that helped me fix them. For example, one of the recipes I had had a typo in the image link for the steps. So, I was able to use a find and replace code in MYSQL to easily fix all of its instances. Once my database was set up, it was time for me to return to my code.</p>
            <h3>Code Development</h3>
                <p>I started this process completely in CSS and HTML. It was straightforward code, and I used stand-in information for the recipe cards and images. At the start of this process, I had just come off of my six-month co-op at SEPTA where I hadn't touched code. This created some difficulty as I refamiliarized myself with CSS. However, by the end of the process I was easily realigning, arranging, and resizing all of the information on my page. By the time I had my database prepared, I was finished with my HTML and almost done with my CSS. This was a blessing, as I could take breaks from either or if one became frustrating. </p>
                <p>I decided to start on my home page and use PHP to call information into the recipe cards there. It was my simplest page and I figured that if anything went wrong, it wouldn't be the most difficult page to fix and navigate. Overall, it turned out to be pretty simple. I was able to call each piece of information I wanted into the lines of the recipe card I had created. This simple code also helped me feel more confident in my abilities. Taking that win, I decided to move onto the page of my site that held all of the recipes. On this page I was able to execute the same code, using a foreach loop, to display all of the recipe cards. However, I deleted the limit of three recipes and made it so that all recipes would display. Then I had to return to my CSS as this was my final page that I had not made variable. After some tweaks and CSS refreshers, I was able to adjust the grid at various screen widths and make it easy to navigate. </p>
                <p>After this point the PHP became more complicated. On the individual recipe page I struggled with understanding the logic behind separating the arrays, specifically in the case of the stepimgs column. I was having trouble differentiating between working with the entire table versus one row. My very kind friend Olivia helped me work through the logic. With that understanding and reinforcement from the lectures I was able to incorporate my code. </p>
                <p>Creating the search bar was extremely difficult. From my references and resources online, I was able to create an effective search bar that would display the recipe cards of any recipe that had a matching value in the search query. However, this search bar only worked when it was placed below all php. I wanted the page with all recipes to display all of the recipes before a search, and with what I had that wasn't possible. So I went back to the drawing board. In my original search bar, it would reference information from the table just as it had in the recipe cards. Working through it with my classmate made me realize that maybe there was a way to reference the information from the recipe pages themselves instead of the table. With that new outlook we were able to develop a code that displayed matching recipe cards, hid cards that did not match, and displayed a “no recipes found” message if there were no matches. </p>
                <p>I had completed the project requirements at this point, but I knew there could still be improvements. I spent the rest of the timeline tweaking the CSS, cleaning up my code, and ensuring that my deliverable would be as complete and thorough as possible. If I had had more time I would have liked to add a login feature, or a feature to add new recipes. Those possible future developments aside, I am fairly proud of my final result.</p>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>This site is my final project. I am extremely proud of how it turned out and what I was able to accomplish within the ten-week timeframe. </p>
            <img class="case-studyimg" src="/content/homePage_image.png" alt="image of index page">
            <p>I wanted a strong header with defining colors to set a fun and funky tone for the site. I also wanted to keep the navigation as straightforward as possible so that a user wouldn't get lost. I decided to add a “favorites” section so I could display a different type of recipe card and add a purpose to the home page beyond a welcome message</p>
            <img class="case-studyimg" src="/content/allrecipes_page.png" alt="image of the all recipes page">
            <p>Using recipe cards made the most sense structurally as it is easy to read and navigate for users. This also aided my PHP as I could pull in specific information into each section and have it displayed in a visually pleasing way.  Initially I intended the sidebar to be a filter section, however with my time constraints and other coursework, I decided against it. Instead, I used that created space to show off top chefs, culinary articles, and other information that the user may be interested in or find value in.</p>
            <img class="case-studyimg" src="/content/searchResults_page.png" alt="Image of recipe results"> 
            <p>I wanted the message to be prominent in the no results. I carried over the same styling, but had to adjust the height of each recipe div. This was due to the grid layout I have set up. If there was only one row the recipe card would take up a larger height than needed, creating excess white space. So, I simply added another class and limited the height to 50%. This worked well and carried over to the different sized screens.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>This project was a success as I achieved the primary objectives: creating a fully responsive recipe website that pulls data from a MySQL database and displays it using PHP. The site meets all the project requirements, including a user-friendly interface for browsing and searching recipes. I learned a lot through this project about using my resources, rethinking certain coding logic, and gained general coding skills. From this project I also gained the important base level knowledge of developers, so that when I design and prototype I can do so in a way that is achievable by developers. I also learned that I prefer to be involved in UI/UX with design over development. However, I see the value and appreciate the lessons I learned during this project.</p>
